# Troubleshooting

## Manual installation

* In Github, go to [Releases, latest](https://github.com/haschdl/pLaunchController/releases/tag/latest),
  and download `pLaunchControl.jar` under Assets.
* Copy the file pLaunchControl.jar to a folder `code` inside your sketch. This method makes the library available
  to an individual sketch.
* Alternatively, if you intend to make the library available to all sketches, unzip the pLaunchControl.zip file to the libraries folder
  of your Processing installation (you can see the default sketchbook location in File -> Preferences). This method
  also makes Examples available.
